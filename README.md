# Intro
It was my school project written in few hours without many comments (yeah, it was hell second day ...) during end of spring 2018.

Also during that time my company servers went down, so a very nice 1 hour trip had been made to our HQ (I left house at 22:00). Then we found out everything is ok, just Internet went down. In entire area and only for our ISP. Thanks coffee!

Have fun! :-)


## What is the Knight's Tour?
It is a known chess problem - travel with Knight on chessboard, but you can stand on every square only once. For those who are interested https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour.

## Warnsdorff's rule
One of the solutions. Basically, every time you are moving to square, which has the fewest free neighbours (free == you were not there yet). There can be equal count of neighbours.
