It was my school project written in few hours without many comments (yeah, it was hell second day ...) during end of spring 2018.
Also during that time my company servers went down, so a very nice 1 hour trip had been made to our HQ (I left house at 22:00). Then we found out everything is ok, just Internet went down. In entire area and only for our ISP. Have fun! :-)
